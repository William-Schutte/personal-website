# William Schutte, 2020

This repository is my personal website and portfolio. This will be the first web page designed, coded, and developed
entirely by myself. This will act as both a professional hub for myself as well as a learning experience and testing
ground for both design and coding  strategies with HTML, CSS, and JS.
